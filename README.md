# OpenNMS opennms collector A plugin Plugin


This plugin was generated by the OPA archetype and is used as example project layout.

The generated plugin contains code examples to demonstrate how to create a:
* Karaf Shell Command (see StatsCommand & TopologyCommand)
* REST Endpoint (see WebhookHandler & WebhookHandlerImpl)
* Event Configuration Extension (see EventConfExtension)
* Alarm Lifecycle Listener (see AlarmForwarder)



Build and install the plugin into your local Maven repository using:

```
mvn clean install
```


From the OpenNMS Karaf shell:
```
feature:repo-add mvn:it.arsinfo/karaf-features/0.1-SNAPSHOT/xml
feature:install opennms-plugins-opennms-collectorB-plugin
```


```
cp assembly/kar/target/opennms-opennms-collectorB-plugin-plugin.kar /opt/opennms/deploy/
feature:install opennms-plugins-opennms-collectorB-plugin
```

```
bundle:watch *
```


You can also access the REST endpoint mounted by the plugin at `http://localhost:8980/opennms/rest/opennms-collector-B-plugin/ping`
